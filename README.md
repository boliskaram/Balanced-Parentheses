# Balanced Parentheses

### The problem of checking if an input string of parentheses is balanced or not is a classic problem in Computer Science. 
### The goal is to determine if a given string contains properly balanced and nested parentheses. 
### This problem can be solved using a stack data structure. 
### A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure that allows you to push and pop elements in a certain order.

### Using stack data structure, implement function to check if given expression have parentheses are balanced or not or neither of parentheses is used.
